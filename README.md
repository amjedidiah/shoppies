## About Me

I am passionate about helping businesses and individuals create more value with the web, as well as helping fellow students learn software development.

I recently spoke at a student conference organized by Microsoft Student Partners in South Africa. Currently, I am a Student Ambassador at FlutterWave as well as enrolled in the Udacity React Nanodegree course to update my front-end knowledge and skill

In the future, I hope to update my back-end skills, learn mobile and cloud-native development, as well as AI/Machine Learning. These, combined with my passion for learning and teaching together with my front-end skills will allow me to create more value for more businesses and individuals, as well as encourage the early adoption of software development skills.

Do you need a website or a web app for your business/idea, a web tutor, or a conference speaker?

Skills: HTML5, React, Redux, Express, Node, PHP, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
