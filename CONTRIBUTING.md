# Contributing

I love and appreciate pull requests from everyone `who knows what they are doing`.

Here are some ways you can contribute:

- by reporting bugs
- by suggesting new features
- by writing or editing documentation
- by writing specifications
- by writing code ( no patch is too small : fix typos, add comments, etc. )
- by refactoring code
- by closing issues
